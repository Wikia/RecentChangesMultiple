- add diff view for new pages collapsed into "(# changes)" - still useful
- add support for newer fandom wikis - specifically walls
- change design somewhat to follow more modern recent changes?
- allow disabling a wiki
- syntax highlight for css/js/lua page previews
- show abuse logs (NOT abuse filter logs; they already show)
- show new message wall messages
- in gallery view changing clicking image to show file page, and make a seperate thing to see full image

############################################
## PRIMARY
############################################
- [Idea] Make a "loader" class to cut down on duplicate code between sitedata, RC, and discussion loading.
- Add a new way to format data (while retaining backwards compatibility)
	- make "data-params" / "&params=" their own params
	- Don't crowd wiki options onto the end of the line; make them sublists
		- Allow links to have http(s) when using this (just remove them; won't be an issue anymore due to line above)
	- make script-wide options on the js page
	- Add way to list wikis on JS page (display on a special:blank page?)
- Better visual loading progress for each wiki on WikiPanel
	- keep icons in same place
	- show loading spinner on top of them.
	- button with option to only show changes for that wiki?
- Add "discussions-enabled" options to individual wikis.
- [Bug] Deleted pages not removed on soft refresh
- Close shadow root? (Chrome shows “shadow root (open)”)
- User info box on hover (since already fetching data for a users' groups)
- [Bug] on FF the page preview replaces current page icon with that wiki's icon

############################################
## SECONDARY
############################################
- Page preview needs a way to load all css / js.
- [Idea] Add Special:RecentChangesLinked support. (may not be possible?)
- [Bug] For Wikia wikis, Comment "move" logs from parent page move can cause errors when it prevents necessary logs from showing up (since logs can't have "hide bot edit" flags)
	- Fixing may not be possible for Wikia wikis, unless logs messages are replaced with parsing RC info (at least for move logs, not possible for all logs)
- [Bug] Ajax image preview: redirected images break. Not able to get info via built-in api "&redirects=1" parameter. May require more than one call to server?
- Translations: support "rtl" lang dir
- Check for memory leaks.
- Make sure all links (even images!) use "//" or https


############################################
## TERTIARY (other / maybe?)
############################################
- Finish RC "params" support - "from", "namespace" (and related ones), etc. May be useful now with "RCMOptions" part of the script
- Better error handling for invalid wiki/timeout (specifics on what went wrong. Hard to do due to ajax not supporting JSONP "NET::" error handling)
- [Idea] Update wiki-specific params to use sub-lists for data. ex: *test.wikia.com \n **hideusers=name \n **params= \n ***param-also-using-sublist \n *next.wikia.com
	- If doing that, may just want to have a json object inside a <pre> block.
- Make sure Script resembles normal RC as closely as possible:
	- uselang=qqx:
		- walls (and probably forums) are a little different in "qqx". ex: wall-recentchanges-thread-group (RCM) vs wall-recentchanges-new-message (RC)
	- Visual:
		- Comment deletions go under "comments", not logs (same for when it's by itself?). I kinda prefer under deletion, but should be consistent.
		- Don't forcefully style diff windows (currently need to since need to load it in, and currently doing so via hard-coding).
- Add an option to temporarily only show edits for a single wiki (hide all the rest). Button would appear to show them all again.

############################################
## ES6 potential rewrites
############################################
- $.extends -> Object.assign
- Objects (hasOwnProperty, loops) -> Map
- Utils.forEach -> for...of
- $.ajax -> fetch()
- className -> classList
- Utils.newElement -> createElement(tag, options)


############################################
## NOT REALLY FEASIBLE (at this time at least)
############################################
- [cross domain / login issue] Show if a RC has been patrolled -- Not possible since it needs to know you are logged in (cross domain issue), and if no patrol right is found, whole request is invalid.
- [cross domain / login issue] bold if watched. Requires user to be logged in to get that info?
- [cross domain / login issue] Rollback support
	- rollback tokens cannot be accessed cross-domain.
	- Most recent version only
		- Need to figure out if listed RC is most recent version (before adding link). Iffy to do without lots of extra loading calls; expensive
		- "rctoponly" - will still most likely require 2nd call, but can get them all in 1 call up to last one retrieved.
			- But would require a small rewrite since all the RCData would have to be looped-through / modified again. Or some kinda fancy custom event system added.
				- If this WAS done, then Board/Thread titles should use same rework to cut down on necessary calls.
	- Getting Rollback Token
		- Get token on click via ajax request? https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Rollback#Token
		- Or maybe get all tokens at once (in a THIRD request) and add them using the rewrite mentioned above
- [wikia mw version doesn't support] Use mw.log.error / warn.
- [wikia mw version doesn't support] mw.user.options.get("timecorrection")
	- Display times using timezone set in preferences ("local" time option should be sufficient?)

== V1.2.2 - 10 January 2016 ==
- [Bug] options cookie changed to be per RCM, not EVERY RCM.
- [Bug] Fixed small code error when wiki doesn't exist / timesout.
- [Bug] diff viewer "Close" button fixed
- Diff viewer close button now looks different from the diff/undo buttons.
- For RCList expand/hide arrows, removed href=”#” (no need for ie back support, and it occasionally causes page to jump to top)
- [Bug] Things that were supposed to be waiting for translations from the server weren't. This has been fixed.
- [Bug] “hidemyself” was not working properly in data-params (hid by default, even though it should show by default. fixed.
- Added link for "Special:Random" to a wiki's info banner
- [Bug] fixed a small code error that was triggered when RCM was refreshed while thread title retrieval wasn't finished.
- Changed diff window text color to near black, since text color on dark wikis is white, and a white diff background is forced due to monobook support.
- Wiki info banner shows some stats on the wiki's count of users/pages/files
- Clicking a favicon along the left side will now bring you to the top of the RCM container, and open the wiki info banner.
- [Bug] Various links were not checking for special characters (specifically ?, but also % and ' and "). This caused links with a "?" at the end to link incorrectly.
- Individual wikis may now define a background color (bgcolor) to show behind recent changes instead of a favicon. Any valid CSS color (or even url()) works.
- [Bug] diff viewer positioning oddly on monobook. Opening it a second time with loaded content fixed.
- On scroll, diff viewer now prevents the page from scrolling while it's open.


== V1.2.1 - 20 December 2015 ==
- Make ajax diff viewer container have a max height less than the screen height (so you scroll container, not page)
	- Moved some inline CSS to stylesheet
- [Bug] Anons were not being detected correctly, causing all links to link to their userpage (like normal users) instead of to their Contributions page.
- "Wikis Loaded" favicons are no longer links; instead, they will bring up an info box with various links (more may be added later):
	- Front page (by clicking name of wiki)
	- Special:RecentChanges (same behavior as before; link has same settings that the script uses for that wiki)
	- Special:NewPages
	- Special:NewFiles
	- Special:Log
	- Special:Insights (if Wikia wiki)
- [Bug] Wall / Board -action- titles were not getting updated via ajax (e.g. reopened thread [thread name]).
- [Bug] When clicking the RC link for a wiki, the script will now include the params from the RCMOptions form (instead of only preset values)
- RCMOptions panel now as an option to remember your changes via a cookie.


== V1.2.0 - 12 December 2015 ==
- changelog file started (changes before this point added retroactively)
- Script pre-loader added (script only loads when needed).
- Rewrite of classes so that they may stand alone (and be loaded in separately in the future).
	- To that end, some Class / variable names were renamed and where/how they were stored was altered.
	- "RecentChangesMultiple" class renamed to "RCMManager" (clarity)
- When side rail is removed, the "home-top-right-ads" is also hidden (was making script look bad).
- options panel uses same collapse code RecentChanmges options panel (even same cookie).
* "&username=" support for external wikis. Disabled by default otherwise, and not necessary for wikia wikis (assuming you use same username).


== V1.1.7 - 1 December 2015 ==

- hideenhanced supported
- rc-params now fall-through rather than replace for wiki-specific params
- more localization support
- Bug fixes


== V1.1.2c - 3 August 2015 ==

== V1.1.2b - 2 August 2015 ==
- fixed an issue with displaying ajax diffs
- added some rollback code (not active since can't tell if a RC is most recent version).
- FF strict mode bug
- Fixed bug nulling something to soon.
- Added Polish translation for something added in V1.2 (translation by Szynka013).


== V1.1.2 - 1 August 2015 ==
- Ajax diff viewer re-added (now does ajax on a case-per-case basis).
- Script now displays a banner if there were no new updates since last time.


== V1.1.1 - 30 July 2015 ==
- Bug fixes:
	- "messages" loading issues fixed
	- forum/board messages group properly
	- auto refresh fixed


== V1.1.0 - 28 July 2015 ==
- Major rewrite using MediaWiki API directly (instead of parsing RSS feed). Code now uses "code.2.js" for file.
- Important notes:
	- "&subdir" removed, and "&scriptdir" added (may be necessary for non-wikia wikis, see above). ex: &scriptdir=w/
	- "data-params" now offers much more support. "days" and "limit" now work up to same amount as normal for each wiki on the list. As such this should be limited to a few days / a lower limit to avoid loading potentially thousands of changes. Individual wikis can have these limits modified using "&params" 
- Changes:
	- Changed translating to use the exact i18n info from Wikia's github for RC_TEXT. Loads RC_TEXT from the server based on your language.
	- Boards/walls now also check for [ restore, delete, remove ] for "replies" instead of assuming it's the actual thread.
	-  All (normal) RecentChanges params supported, except "hideenhanced", "from", and viewing a select namespace.
	- Bot edits can now be shown (off by default), and "minor" edits are now marked.
	- gApp instance turned into the RecentChangesMultiple class (to potentially run multiple for whatever reason, plus I prefer "traditional" OO class structures)
		- As such, #rc-content-multiple id should now be a .rc-content-multiple class to allow for multiple instances (although using ids is still supported) 
	- Additional Special:RecentChanges CSS classes used.
	- Rewrote RC / RCList objects (to bring a little more inline with how it's structure in mw system)
	- New "WikiData" class for storing wiki-specific data in a more understandable way, while also providing helper methods
	- data-groupaddcategories support removed
